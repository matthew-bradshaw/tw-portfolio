# Proposal Sample

## Overview

This Proposal is a combined Pilot Training Transformation (PTT) Platform / Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) flight simulation environment, capable of fixed and rotary-winged aircraft simulation for today’s Air Force pilots. The Proposal is a hot-swap capable pilot simulation program, combined with ready-to-train hardware, that is used for both in-person (on-premises) and remote (offsite) use. The Proposal is fully compliant with the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) goal of scalability across platforms.

### Goals

1. Successfully combine readily-available COTS software with the PTT platform’s
current Google Cloud Products (GCP) server functionality.

2. Using an Internet of Things (IOT) approach, we envision a cloud-based combination
of hardware-provisioning for training units, continued training support through the
cloud, and a fully-functional update system utilizing COTS software for continued
support, starting with the TH-1H helicopter.
